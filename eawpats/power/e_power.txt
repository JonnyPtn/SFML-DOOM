        Yes, this is yet another drum kit release from Elysium
    Entertainment.  This archive contains several Gate, Power,
    and Room drum kits for the Advanced Gravis (c) UltraSound.
    The banks are classified as Non-GS, GS, GS+, and GS++.  The
    GS+ and GS++ are our 'supersets' of Roland's (c) GS standard.
    All of the following banks include the GS Room Drum Kit's
    Toms.

        Patches, check out ProPats v3.0 at a site near you!!

    Note: The bank placement of the Non-GS, GS+, and GS++ seemed
    logical although is does not follow any particular banking
    standard.

these patches.  Please make sure you keep backups of any patches that

another question.  =)
