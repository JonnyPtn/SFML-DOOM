        This contains my GS Drum Set #40.  In plain English, this means
that this is a Brush Drum Set.  The GUS Patches contained in this ZIP
are as follows :

        Br_Slap.Pat   (16k)
        Br_Swirl.Pat (124k)
        Br_Swish.Pat (6.5k)
        HiHatCl.Pat (14.5k)
        HiHatOp.Pat (77.5k)

        Sorry for the delay, but my life is currently revolving around
College and a new job.  =)  This is the first ZIP of GS drum sets I will
be uploading.  I hope you can find these useful and/or entertaining.
Read GSDrum40.Doc for instructions on installation.  Bank.Inf contains
the patch maps for those who know how to install custom patches.  Enjoy
these and my future releases...

Any feedback/comments/flames welcome regarding my work.
