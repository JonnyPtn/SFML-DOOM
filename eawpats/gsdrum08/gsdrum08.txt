        This contains our GS Drum Set #08.  In plain English, this means
that this is a Room Drum Set.  The GUS Patches contained in this ZIP
are as follows :

        RoomLow2.Pat    (48k)
        RoomLow1.Pat  (41.5k)
        RoomMid2.Pat    (30k)
        RoomMid1.Pat    (26k)
        RoomHi2.Pat     (21k)
        RoomHi1.Pat   (16.5k)

        Sorry for the delay, but my life is currently revolving around
College and a new job.  =)  This is the second ZIP of GS drum sets that
I am uploading.  I hope you can find these useful and/or entertaining.
Read GSDrum08.Doc for instructions on installation.  Bank.Inf contains
the patch maps for these patches.  Enjoy these and my future releases...
