          Tabla:

          The system used here to map the bols  (tabla syllables)
          to MIDI notes involved creating an interpretation of
          the tabla compositions for a Roland U220 tabla sample.
          Some compromise was necessary to arrange the material
          first for tabla samples, as they were not as complete
          as would be ideal, and then for General MIDI conga and
          bongo, but the general feeling of the compositions come
          through.

          The Bayan Drum

          The bayan  is the larger and lower in pitch of the two
          drums that comprise the tabla set. Its pitch is
          variable. To simulate this using the Roland U220
          sample, an auto bend function was used. The parameter
          was set so that it would not activate on staccato
          notes. Staccato notes where set to decay quickly, which
          allowed for the simulation of both an open variable
          pitch sound and a closed staccato sound with one
          sample. The notes were then mapped to coincide with the
          conga samples in the GM Standard MIDI setup.

          Suggested substitutions: If bayan samples are not
          available, try mixing a timpani sample with a conga
          sample.

          The Tabla Drum

          The tabla  is the smaller and higher in pitch of the
          two drums that comprise the tabla set. The tabla has
          both open and closed sounds. The most completely open
          sound of the tabla is a minor or major seventh below
          the tonic that the drum is tuned to.

          Suggested substitutes: sampled string harmonics mixed
          with sampled conga or bongo.
