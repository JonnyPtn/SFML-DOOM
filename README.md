# SFML-DOOM

Original DOOM source code ported to c++, using SFML for the rendering, sounds and events. Only a rough job at the moment so don't expect a flawless experience. Only dependency is theoretically SFML, but I've only built on win32 so far so no idea if it works on other platforms

Very open to suggestions/requests so just let me know!
