# SFML-DOOM

Original DOOM source code ported to c++, using SFML for the rendering, sounds and events. Only a rough job at the moment so don't expect a flawless experience. I've build on windows and linux successfully, although because of all the mental pointer arithmetic it only works as a 32bit app for now.

Very open to suggestions/requests so just let me know!
